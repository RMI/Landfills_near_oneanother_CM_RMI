# plume_attribution_infrastructure_QC_list

This repository contains a waste_sites_3km.csv file that keeps track of waste sites that are close to each other and should be manually QA/QCed for plume attribution. This is a community project and we welcome other organizations to contribute to this QA/QC. We will expand the list to include other sectors in the future. 

As of now,  waste_sites_3km.csv file contains waste sites that are within 3 km from each other. The locations of the sites were obtained from Climate TRACE waste sector dataset, which is available here: https://climatetrace.org/downloads. All data included here was produced by Climate TRACE.

The processing code is also included.
